This is a basic driver to understand the basic framework of a driver see the process of loading and unloading the driver from the kernel.

Steps to do
1. Clone the  ldd_hello.c and Makefile 
2. make 
3. Once make is successful, check the resulted files
      ls 
you can see lot of files , out of that ldd_hello.ko is our kernel driver file
3. clear the kernel messge by writing 
      sudo dmesg -c
4. load the driver to kernel
      sudo insmod ldd_hello.ko
5. if it is success, check the kernel msg with
      sudo dmesg 
6. check whether the driver is actually loaded to the kernel with;
      lsmod
and you must see ldd_hello driver
7. unload the driver 
      sudo rmmod ldd_hello.ko
8. if its successful, you can see the kernel msg
      sudo dmesg
9. check whether driver is actually unloaded
      lsmod
