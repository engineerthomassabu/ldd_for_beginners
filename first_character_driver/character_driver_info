This is a basic character driver example

Before trying this, learn what is character driver, major number and minor number /dev folder etc

also, get familiar with linux command such as chmod, mknod etc.


Steps to do
1. Clone   
2. make 
3. Once make is successful, check the resulted files
      ls 
you can see lot of files , out of that character_driver.ko is our kernel driver file
3. clear the kernel messge by writing 
      sudo dmesg -c
4. check lsmod and check whether character_driver is there. Ideally it should not be there

5. check ls /dev/ and check whether the driver entry is available or not, it should not be there as we havent loaded the driver yet

6. load the driver to kernel
      sudo insmod character_driver.ko
7. if it is success, check the kernel msg with
      sudo dmesg
      note the major and minor nos
8. check whether the driver is actually loaded to the kernel with;
      lsmod
and you must see character_driver

9. create the character device with mknod command
sudo mknod /dev/mychardev c 241 0

10. give read and write permission to the device
sudo chmod 666 /dev/mychardev

11. try ls  and check whether the device entry is done ?
	ls /dev/
   if its success, we can see mychardev in  /dev
 

12. try to read the device
	cat /dev/mychardev
        there is nothing inside the file to read. just try sudo dmesg to understand the file is opened aand tried read
13. Try to write to the device
	echo "Hello Kernel" > /dev/mychardev	
 	try sudo dmesg
	Now read the device and we can see the data we wrote to the device

14. unload the driver 
      sudo rmmod character_driver

15 to remove the device
	sudo rm /dev/mychardev
