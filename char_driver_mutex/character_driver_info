This is a basic character driver with struct class to create and delete device node automoatically

Before trying this, learn what is character driver, major number and minor number /dev folder etc


Steps to do
1. Clone   
2. make 
3. Once make is successful, check the resulted files
      ls 
you can see lot of files , out of that character_driver.ko is our kernel driver file
3. clear the kernel messge by writing 
      sudo dmesg -c
4. check lsmod and check whether character_driver is there. Ideally it should not be there

5. check ls /dev/ and check whether the driver entry is available or not, it should not be there as we havent loaded the driver yet

6. load the driver to kernel
      sudo insmod character_driver.ko
7. if it is success, check the kernel msg with
      sudo dmesg
      note the major and minor nos
8. check whether the driver is actually loaded to the kernel with;
      lsmod
and you must see character_driver

9. try ls  and check whether the device entry is done ?
	ls /dev/
   if its success, we can see mychardev in  /dev
 
10. try to read the device
	sudo cat /dev/mychardev
        there is nothing inside the file to read. just try sudo dmesg to understand the file is opened aand tried read
11. Try to write to the device
	sudo echo "Hello Kernel" > /dev/mychardev | sudo tee /dev/myclassdev
 	try sudo dmesg
	Now read the device and we can see the data we wrote to the device
       
  
12. unload the driver 
      sudo rmmod character_driver
